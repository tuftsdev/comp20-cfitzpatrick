Everything in this assignment has been implemented correctly.

I worked alone on this assignment.

I spent about two hours on this assignment.

You cannot load a file from a local machine nor can you do so from another host. For security reasons, the web browser cannot have access to your local files because, if it could, people you may not trust may be able to read everything on your computer. 

The same-origin policy prevents the XMLHttpRequest request from going through when the file is hosted on a different website. If one program was able to make requests to different servers, then a malicious website could see what your are doing on other websites, for example typing in your credit card information.
