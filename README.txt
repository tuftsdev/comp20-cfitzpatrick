This the my Git repository for Comp 20 (Web Programming) for the Spring Semester of 2016.

My favorite assignment in this class was landmarks. Despite the fact that it is a decently complex site, it came together so quickly. That was also the first time that I worked with a web server and parsing nicely packaged data was so much easier than I imagined it would be.

I have grown a ton from this class and this semester. Coming in, I just new a bit about client side js/css/html but overall I had really minimal experience in web development. Now I’m familiar with so many new concepts and also feel like I am able to read documentation and figure things out a lot better.

The most important thing that I learned in this course was to never trust user input. The first example being when Ming told us about some of the massive hacks and told us that many of them were easily preventable by sanitizing data before sending it to the server. The second was when I actually hacked somebody else project.

I’d like to delve into the server side more deeply. After the group project, I am confident setting them up and familiar with with Mongo syntax but want to learn how to build them more efficiently (both in terms of size and speed).
